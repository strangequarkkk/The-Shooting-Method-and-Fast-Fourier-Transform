# The-Shooting-Method-and-Fast-Fourier-Transform.

Python libraries used: Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib.pyplot.

In this Coursework/Project, 

1) Wrote a program to plot the Fourier Transform of a function in position domain and explored the fundamental inverse relation between the 'width' of a function in position domain and the 'width' of the fourier transformed function (in k domain).

2) Discretized the time independent schrodinger equation and then wrote a python program based on the 'shooting method' to solve for eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator. Also wrote a program for the normalization of the relevant eigenfunction.

I have attached the relevant question sheet and recommend that it be read while you're looking at the code. The programs were written in a Jupyter Notebook which has been attached.

If you need any more information/explanation related to the code, don't hesitate to contact me.
